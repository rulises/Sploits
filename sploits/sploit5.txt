This attack exploits a format string vulnerability. It does this by overwriting the address  pointed in the buffer, with the %n string format, which purspose is overwrite  the eip. This allows the stack pointer to point to the address of back to the  attack buffer. 

First step was calculate the right number of %u, that were needed to move the stack pointer to the buffer memory location.Then the second %n is written to overwrite the las byte of the address, otherwise it won't let give us the address of the  buffer.
